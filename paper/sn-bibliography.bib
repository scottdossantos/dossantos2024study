	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental designs that take advantage of high-throughput sequencing to generate datasets include RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments, metagenomic analysis and selective growth experiments. In each case the underlying data are similar and are composed of counts of sequencing reads mapped to a large number of features in each sample. Despite this underlying similarity, the data analysis methods used for these experimental designs are all different, and do not translate across experiments. Alternative methods have been developed in the physical and geological sciences that treat similar data as compositions. Compositional data analysis methods transform the data to relative abundances with the result that the analyses are more robust and reproducible.
RESULTS: Data from an in vitro selective growth experiment, an RNA-seq experiment and the Human Microbiome Project 16S rRNA gene abundance dataset were examined by ALDEx2, a compositional data analysis tool that uses Bayesian methods to infer technical and statistical error. The ALDEx2 approach is shown to be suitable for all three types of data: it correctly identifies both the direction and differential abundance of features in the differential growth experiment, it identifies a substantially similar set of differentially expressed genes in the RNA-seq dataset as the leading tools and it identifies as differential the taxa that distinguish the tongue dorsum and buccal mucosa in the Human Microbiome Project dataset. The design of ALDEx2 reduces the number of false positive identifications that result from datasets composed of many features in few samples.
CONCLUSION: Statistical analysis of high-throughput sequencing datasets composed of per feature counts showed that the ALDEx2 R package is a simple and robust tool, which can be applied to RNA-seq, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and differential growth datasets, and by extension to other techniques that use a similar approach.},

Notably, remission in three patients necessitated repeated VMT, including a donor change in one patient, to elicit a long-standing clinical response. The therapeutic efficacy of VMT in women with intractable and recurrent bacterial vaginosis should be further determined in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a very common cause of vaginitis that has been associated with a high incidence of obstetric and gynaecologic complications and increased risk of HIV-1 transmission. This has led to renewed research interest in its treatment. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antimicrobial agents on BV in non-pregnant women. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and African Healthline (December 2007); and proceedings of relevant international conferences (from 1981 to date). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing any two or more antimicrobial agents, or antimicrobial agents with placebo or no treatment, in women with clinical or Gram-stain criteria of BV. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from the original publications while the third author cross checked the data. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four trials involving 4422 participants were reviewed. Most examined symptomatic women only. Only seven trials analysed results by intention to treat; we re-analysed the remainder.Compared with placebo, clindamycin showed a lower rate of treatment failure (relative risk (RR) 0.25, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.37). Clindamycin and metronidazole showed identical rates of treatment failure, irrespective of regimen type, at two and four-week follow up (RR 1.01, 95\% CI 0.69 to 1.46; RR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.70 to 1.18, respectively). Clindamycin tended to cause a lower rate of adverse events (RR 0.75, 95\% CI 0.56 to 1.02); metallic taste, and nausea and vomiting were more common in the metronidazole group (RR 0.08, 95\% CI 0.1 to 0.59; RR 0.23, 95\% CI 0.10 to 0.51, respectively). Given intravaginally as gelatin tablets, lactobacillus was more effective than oral metronidazole (RR 0.20, 95\% CI 0.05 to 0.08). Similarly, oral lactobacillus combined with metronidazole was more effective than metronidazole alone (RR 0.33, 95\% CI 0.14 to 0.77). Clindamycin showed a lower rate of clinical failure than triple sulfonamide cream (RR 0.46, 95\% CI 0.29 to 0.72). Hydrogen peroxide douche showed a higher rate of clinical failure (RR 1.75, 95\% CI 1.02 to 3.00) and adverse events (RR 2.33, 95\% CI 1.21 to 4.52) than a single 2 g dose of metronidazole. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Clindamycin preparations, oral metronidazole, and oral and intravaginal tablets of lactobacillus were effective for bacterial vaginosis. Hydrogen peroxide douche and triple sulphonamide cream were ineffective. Metronidazole caused metallic taste, nausea and vomiting. We need better-designed trials with larger sample sizes to test the effectiveness of promising drugs.},

@article{Allsworth:2011aa,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and incident sexually transmitted infection (STI) varies with more extreme BV scores.
STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the data from 535 women who were enrolled in a randomized trial to promote dual method contraceptive use. Incident STI was defined as any case of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. BV was defined by Gram stain (Nugent score). STI risk was estimated with the use of proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: Binary (0-6 vs 7-10) and 3-level (negative 0-3, intermediate 4-6, or BV 7-10) categorizations were not associated with time to STI; however, women with the highest Nugent scores (9-10) had a 2.1-fold increased risk of STI (95% confidence interval, 1.05-4.28), compared with women with normal flora.
CONCLUSION: Nugent score>8 is associated with incident STI. More accurate classification of BV will allow clinicians to identify those women who are at greatest risk of STI.},

	abstract = {Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a serious global problem, causing disease, suffering, and death. Although bacterial vaginosis (BV) is not considered to be an STI, it may be associated with an increased risk of contracting a wide range of STIs. We sought to assess the link between the different microorganisms involved in STIs and BV. A total of 290 vaginal swabs from 290 women sent for diagnostic purposes to the clinical microbiology laboratory of the Marseille University Public Hospitals were tested by specific qPCR targeting STI-causing microorganisms and BV. Of these 290 swabs, 15.2% (44/290) were diagnosed with at least one STI-causing microorganism and 17.2% (50/290) with BV. The prevalence of STIs was significantly higher in women with BV (28%, 14/50) than in those without (20.4%, 51/240). The prevalence of co-infections involving two STI-causing microorganisms was significantly more frequent in women with BV than in those without (18% [8/50] vs. 2% [5/250]; p < 0.001). The prevalence of monoinfections and polyinfections with STI-causing microorganisms was lower in women without BV than in those with (8.8% [21/240] vs. 28% [14/50]), p < 0.001 and 2% (5/240) vs. 8% (4/50), p = 0.05, respectively). Our data suggest that a correlation between BV and STI may exist, with a higher prevalence of both monoinfections and polyinfections involving STI-causing microorganisms in women with BV. Further research is needed to better understand BV and its links to STIs.},

@article{Tarracchini:2020aa,
	abstract = {Gardnerella vaginalis is described as a common anaerobic vaginal bacterium whose presence may correlate with vaginal dysbiotic conditions. In the current study, we performed phylogenomic analyses of 72 G. vaginalis genome sequences, revealing noteworthy genome differences underlying a polyphyletic organization of this taxon. Particularly, the genomic survey revealed that this species may actually include nine distinct genotypes (GGtype1 to GGtype9). Furthermore, the observed link between sialidase and phylogenomic grouping provided clues of a connection between virulence potential and the evolutionary history of this microbial taxon. Specifically, based on the outcomes of these in silico analyses, GGtype3, GGtype7, GGtype8, and GGtype9 appear to have virulence potential since they exhibited the sialidase gene in their genomes. Notably, the analysis of 34 publicly available vaginal metagenomic samples allowed us to trace the distribution of the nine G. vaginalis genotypes identified in this study among the human population, highlighting how differences in genetic makeup could be related to specific ecological properties. Furthermore, comparative genomic analyses provided details about the G. vaginalis pan- and core genome contents, including putative genetic elements involved in the adaptation to the ecological niche as well as many putative virulence factors. Among these putative virulence factors, particularly noteworthy genes identified were the gene encoding cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) toxin vaginolysin and genes related to microbial biofilm formation, iron uptake, adhesion to the vaginal epithelium, as well as macrolide antibiotic resistance.IMPORTANCE The identification of nine different genotypes among members of G. vaginalis allowed us to distinguish an uneven distribution of virulence-associated genetic traits within this taxon and thus suggest the potential occurrence of putative pathogen and commensal G. vaginalis strains. These findings, coupled with metagenomics microbial profiling of human vaginal microbiota, permitted us to get insights into the distribution of the genotypes among the human population, highlighting the presence of different structural communities in terms of G. vaginalis genotypes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common vaginal condition of reproductive-aged women, is associated with a highly diverse and heterogeneous microbiota. Here we present a proof-of-principle analysis to uncover the function of the microbiota using meta-RNA-seq to uncover genes and pathways that potentially differentiate healthy vaginal microbial communities from those in the dysbiotic state of bacterial vaginosis (BV).
RESULTS: The predominant organism, Lactobacillus iners, was present in both conditions and showed a differing expression profile in BV compared to healthy. Despite its minimal genome, L. iners differentially expressed over 10% of its gene complement. Notably, in a BV environment L. iners increased expression of a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, and of mucin and glycerol transport and related metabolic enzymes. Genes belonging to a CRISPR system were greatly upregulated suggesting that bacteriophage influence the community. Reflective of L. iners, the bacterial community as a whole demonstrated a preference for glycogen and glycerol as carbon sources under BV conditions. The predicted end-products of metabolism under BV conditions include an abundance of succinate and other short-chain fatty-acids, while healthy conditions are predicted to largely contain lactic acid.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the importance of understanding the functional activity of the bacterial community in addition to characterizing the population structure when investigating the human microbiome.},

	abstract = {eggNOG is a public database of orthology relationships, gene evolutionary histories and functional annotations. Here, we present version 5.0, featuring a major update of the underlying genome sets, which have been expanded to 4445 representative bacteria and 168 archaea derived from 25 038 genomes, as well as 477 eukaryotic organisms and 2502 viral proteomes that were selected for diversity and filtered by genome quality. In total, 4.4M orthologous groups (OGs) distributed across 379 taxonomic levels were computed together with their associated sequence alignments, phylogenies, HMM models and functional descriptors. Precomputed evolutionary analysis provides fine-grained resolution of duplication/speciation events within each OG. Our benchmarks show that, despite doubling the amount of genomes, the quality of orthology assignments and functional annotations (80% coverage) has persisted without significant changes across this update. Finally, we improved eggNOG online services for fast functional annotation and orthology prediction of custom genomics or metagenomics datasets. All precomputed data are publicly available for downloading or via API queries at http://eggnog.embl.de.},

	abstract = {The benefit of integrating batches of genomic data to increase statistical power is often hindered by batch effects, or unwanted variation in data caused by differences in technical factors across batches. It is therefore critical to effectively address batch effects in genomic data to overcome these challenges. Many existing methods for batch effects adjustment assume the data follow a continuous, bell-shaped Gaussian distribution. However in RNA-seq studies the data are typically skewed, over-dispersed counts, so this assumption is not appropriate and may lead to erroneous results. Negative binomial regression models have been used previously to better capture the properties of counts. We developed a batch correction method, ComBat-seq, using a negative binomial regression model that retains the integer nature of count data in RNA-seq studies, making the batch adjusted data compatible with common differential expression software packages that require integer counts. We show in realistic simulations that the ComBat-seq adjusted data results in better statistical power and control of false positives in differential expression compared to data adjusted by the other available methods. We further demonstrated in a real data example that ComBat-seq successfully removes batch effects and recovers the biological signal in the data.},

	abstract = {Experimental variance is a major challenge when dealing with high-throughput sequencing data. This variance has several sources: sampling replication, technical replication, variability within biological conditions, and variability between biological conditions. The high per-sample cost of RNA-Seq often precludes the large number of experiments needed to partition observed variance into these categories as per standard ANOVA models. We show that the partitioning of within-condition to between-condition variation cannot reasonably be ignored, whether in single-organism RNA-Seq or in Meta-RNA-Seq experiments, and further find that commonly-used RNA-Seq analysis tools, as described in the literature, do not enforce the constraint that the sum of relative expression levels must be one, and thus report expression levels that are systematically distorted. These two factors lead to misleading inferences if not properly accommodated. As it is usually only the biological between-condition and within-condition differences that are of interest, we developed ALDEx, an ANOVA-like differential expression procedure, to identify genes with greater between- to within-condition differences. We show that the presence of differential expression and the magnitude of these comparative differences can be reasonably estimated with even very small sample sizes.},

However, progress in this field has been limited because quantifying bacteria in natural specimens is an arduous process. We developed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays to facilitate assessments of bacterial abundance in vaginal specimens and evaluated the utility of these assays by measuring species abundance in patients whose vaginal floras were clinically described as normal, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as defined by Nugent's criteria. The qPCR measurements showed that Lactobacillus species were predominant in normal vaginal specimens and that high Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus jensenii abundance was specific to normal specimens, while Lactobacillus iners abundance was high in all categories including BV. The abundances of all non-Lactobacillus species were higher in BV specimens than in normal specimens. Prevotella species were prevalent in all specimens and represented a high percentage of total species in BV specimens. qPCR assays can be a useful tool for describing the structure of vaginal communities and elucidating their role in health and disease.},

@article{France:2022aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vaginal bacterial communities dominated by Lactobacillus species are associated with a reduced risk of various adverse health outcomes. However, somewhat unexpectedly, many healthy women have microbiota that are not dominated by lactobacilli. To determine the factors that drive vaginal community composition we characterized the genetic composition and transcriptional activities of vaginal microbiota in healthy women.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that the abundance of a species is not always indicative of its transcriptional activity and that impending changes in community composition can be predicted from metatranscriptomic data. Functional comparisons highlight differences in the metabolic activities of these communities, notably in their degradation of host produced mucin but not glycogen. Degradation of mucin by communities not dominated by Lactobacillus may play a role in their association with adverse health outcomes. Finally, we show that the transcriptional activities of L. crispatus, L. iners, and Gardnerella vaginalis vary with the taxonomic composition of the communities in which they reside. Notably, L. iners and G. vaginalis both demonstrate lower expression of their cholesterol-dependent cytolysins when co-resident with Lactobacillus spp. and higher expression when co-resident with other facultative and obligate anaerobes. The pathogenic potential of these species may depend on the communities in which they reside and thus could be modulated by interventional strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide insight to the functional ecology of the vaginal microbiota, demonstrate the diagnostic potential of metatranscriptomic data, and reveal strategies for the management of these ecosystems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal syndrome among women in their reproductive years. It is associated with an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections and complications like preterm labor. BV is characterized by a high recurrence rate for which biofilms frequently found on vaginal epithelial cells may be a reason.
RESULTS: Here, we report a controlled randomized clinical trial that tested the safety and effectiveness of a newly developed pessary containing an amphoteric tenside (WO3191) to disrupt biofilms after metronidazole treatment of BV. Pessaries containing lactic acid were provided to the control group, and microbial community composition was determined via Illumina sequencing of the V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The most common community state type (CST) in healthy women was characterized by Lactobacillus crispatus. In BV, diversity was high with communities dominated by either Lactobacillus iners, Prevotella bivia, Sneathia amnii, or Prevotella amnii. Women with BV and proven biofilms had an increased abundance of Sneathia sanguinegens and a decreased abundance of Gardnerella vaginalis. Following metronidazole treatment, clinical symptoms cleared, Nugent score shifted to Lactobacillus dominance, biofilms disappeared, and diversity (Shannon index) was reduced in most women. Most of the patients responding to therapy exhibited a L. iners CST. Treatment with WO 3191 reduced biofilms but did not prevent recurrence. Women with high diversity after antibiotic treatment were more likely to develop recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Stabilizing the low diversity healthy flora by promoting growth of health-associated Lactobacillus sp. such as L. crispatus may be beneficial for long-term female health.

	abstract = {Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a prevalent multifactorial disease of women in their reproductive years characterized by a shift from the Lactobacillus species-dominated microbial community toward a taxonomically diverse anaerobic community. For unknown reasons, some women do not respond to therapy. In our recent clinical study, among 37 women diagnosed with BV, 31 were successfully treated with metronidazole, while 6 still had BV after treatment. To discover possible reasons for the lack of response in those patients, we performed a metatranscriptome analysis of their vaginal microbiota, comparing them to the patients who responded. Seven of 8 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) genes of Gardnerella vaginalis were highly upregulated in nonresponding patients. Cas genes, in addition to protecting against phages, might be involved in DNA repair, thus mitigating the bactericidal effect of DNA-damaging agents such as metronidazole. In the second part of our study, we analyzed the vaginal metatranscriptomes of four patients over 3~months and showed high in vivo expression of genes for pore-forming toxins in L.~iners and of genes encoding enzymes for the production of hydrogen peroxide and d-lactate in L.~crispatus.IMPORTANCE Bacterial vaginosis is a serious issue for women in their reproductive years. Although it can usually be cured by antibiotics, the recurrence rate is very high, and some women do not respond to antibiotic therapy. The reasons for that are not known. Therefore, we undertook a study to detect the activity of the complete microbiota in the vaginal fluid of women who responded to antibiotic therapy and compared it to the activity of the microbiota in women who did not respond. We found that one of the most important pathogens in bacterial vaginosis, Gardnerella vaginalis, has activated genes that can repair the DNA damage caused by the antibiotic in those women that do not respond to therapy. Suppressing these genes might be a possibility to improve the antibiotic therapy of bacterial vaginosis.},

However, meta-transcriptomic experiments can be investigated in a principled manner using Bayesian probabilistic modeling of the data at a functional level coupled with analysis under a compositional data analysis paradigm. We present a worked example for the differential functional evaluation of mixed-species microbial communities obtained from human clinical samples that were sequenced on an Illumina platform. We demonstrate methods to functionally map reads directly, conduct a compositionally appropriate exploratory data analysis, evaluate differential relative abundance, and finally identify compositionally associated (constant ratio) functions. Using these approaches we have found that meta-transcriptomic functional analyses are highly reproducible and convey significant information regarding the ecosystem.},

Changes in the vaginal microbiota have been associated with several adverse health outcomes including premature birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, and acquisition of HIV infection. Cultivation-independent molecular methods have provided new insights regarding bacterial diversity in this important niche, particularly in women with the common condition bacterial vaginosis (BV). PCR methods have shown that women with BV have complex communities of vaginal bacteria that include many fastidious species, particularly from the phyla Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Healthy women are mostly colonized with lactobacilli such as Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus iners, though a variety of other bacteria may be present. The microbiology of BV is heterogeneous. The presence of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae coating the vaginal epithelium in some subjects with BV suggests that biofilms may contribute to this condition.},
