------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fig 1: Workflow summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A) - Added white box and text to obscure the original dataset names, change
     them to 'London', 'Europe' and 'Virginia' for consistency, and correct a
     Typo (BioRender figure incorrectly says n=22 for London dataset).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fig 2: London & Europe Dataset summary / functional heatmaps & biplot
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A) - Added lines surrounding colour boxes and heatmap colour scale in the 
     legend.
   - Added white boxes to obscure original numeric labels on colour scale and 
     added corresponding text boxes with larger sized font.
   - Added a label of 'Proportion' to the heatmap colour scale.

B) - Added white boxes to obscure original numeric and text labels for the x 
     and y axes of the PCA plot and density plots, and added text boxes with
     corresponding labels in a larger font size (except for density plot x/y 
     axis tick labels).
   - Clipped both density plots and moved them closer to the corresponding y
     and x axes of the PCA plot to reduce the gap between them.
   - Added a large white box to the bottom-left corner of the PCA plot to 
     obscure the original species -> colour legend and added text boxes and
     coloured circles corresponding to the original legend, but in a larger 
     font size and on the bottom right-hand corner of the figure.
   - Obscured the original figure title at the top-centre of the figure with 
     a white box and added a horizontal black line to fill in the resulting 
     gap at the top y-axis.

c) - Added lines surrounding colour boxes and heatmap colour scale in the 
     legend.
   - Added white box to obscure original text labels (pathways) and replaced 
     these with the same labels, but rotated to ~45 degrees. Also added black 
     tick marks to show which label goes with which column.
   - Added white boxes to obscure original numeric labels on colour scale and 
     added corresponding text boxes with larger sized font.
   - Rotated the heatmap colour scale bar and added the text label 'Mean
     CLR Z-score'.
   - Clipped the heatmap legend into the three separate categories (CST, BV 
     status, Dataset) and arranged as two columns at the top of the heatmap.
   - Added white boxes to obscure ' (H)' and ' (BV)' at the end of several 
     pathway labels as they were not necessary in this subset of pathways.

D) - No changes- made with BioRender and original figure is on GitHub.

E) - FOR REVIEWER RESPONSES: Edited the colour for CST IV and re-made this
     individual heatmap. Cropped just the tree and colour bars from the new
     heatmap and overlaid onto the existing heatmap data from the 'old' Fig
     2C. All data is identical except the colour for CST IV!

Fig 3: BV subgroup analyses for London/Europe datasets with stacked bar graphs
       for composition (BVAB1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   - Clipped the heatmap to keep only the first three cutree groups (i.e. top 
     25 pathways).
   - Added lines surrounding legend colour boxes and heatmap colour scale.
   - Added white boxes to obscure original numeric labels on colour scale and 
     added corresponding text boxes with larger sized font.
   - Rotated the heatmap colour scale bar and added the text label 'Mean CLR 
     Z-score'.
   - Clipped the heatmap legend from the rest of the figure and arranged it to 
     the right of the row labels.
   - Made 3 copies of the stacked bar graph and clipped two in the  middle to
     emphasise to introduce a slight gap at the divide between BV1 and BV2 
     samples. Clipped the third to keep only the minor grid lines between this
     gap and widened it to 'fit' into the resulting gap between both halves of
     the stacked bar graph.
   - Added a long white box to obscure the x axis tick lines at the bottom of 
     the graph.
   - Added coloured lines and text boxes to identify BV subgroups.
   - Added a white box to obscure original species labels in the legend and 
     replaced labels with text boxes of the same sized font as in the heatmap.

Fig 4: Pregnant vs. non-pregnant metatranscriptome violin plot and Gardnerella 
       spp. biplots
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) - Clipped the figure to remove the x-axis tick labels and title. Replaced 
     with text boxes corresponding to original labels/title but in a larger 
     font size.
   - Added white box to obscure 'Atopobium vaginae' and replaced with a text
     box containing 'Fannyhessea vaginae' as per reviewer 1's request.
   - Added coloured boxes to obscure the (n = xx) for London and Europe title
     boxes and replaced with text boxes containing the CORRECT group sizes.

B) - Added white boxes to obscure original numeric and text labels for the x 
     and y axes of the PCA plot and density plots, and added text boxes with 
     corresponding labels in a larger font size (except for density plot x/y 
     axis tick labels).
   - Clipped both density plots and moved them closer to the corresponding y 
     and x axes of the PCA plot to reduce the gap between them.
   - Added a large white box to the bottom-right corner of the PCA plot to cover
     the original species colour legend and added text boxes corresponding to 
     the original legend, but in italic font. Also added a transparent circle
     with dotted black outline and a text box containing '(not drawn)' which
     corresponds to the 'Other taxa' label.

Fig 5: Functional heatmaps for Virginia dataset
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) - Added lines surrounding colour boxes and the heatmap colour scale in the
     legend.
   - Rotated the heatmap colour scale bar and added the text label, 'Mean CLR 
     Z-score'.   
   - Added white boxes to obscure original numeric labels on colour scale and
     added corresponding text boxes with rotated labels.
   - Clipped the heatmap legend into the two separate categories (CST, Group)
     and arranged as three columns at the right-hand side of the heatmap.
   - Added a white box to obscure column colour bar labels, 'Group' and 'CST'.

B) - Clipped the heatmap legend into two halves (CST, Subgroup) and arranged 
     as two columns at the right-hand side of the heatmap.
   - Added a vertical text box with the label 'Mean CLR Z-score' to the right
     of the heatmap colour scale bar. 
   - Added a white box to obscure column colour bar labels, 'Group' and 'CST'.
   - Added a white box to obscure the text label for 'Biofilm formation' and 
     replaced with a text box containing 'Exopolysaccharide biosynthesis'. I
     could've replaced the label in R, but am very lazy and chose to do this 
     instead. It's the same KO term (K11936). Sorrynotsorry.

C) - Added lines surrounding the legend colour boxes and heatmap colour scale.
   - Rotated the heatmap colour scale bar and added the text label 'Mean CLR 
     Z-score'.   
   - Added white boxes to obscure original numeric labels on colour scale and
     added corresponding text boxes with rotated labels.
   - Clipped the heatmap legend into two halves (CST, Group) and arranged as
     three columns at the right-hand side of the heatmap.
   - Added a white box to obscure the legend text labels, 'Group' and replaced
     with a text box containing 'Subgroup'
   - Added a white box to obscure column colour bar labels, 'Group' and 'CST'.
   - Added white boxes to obscure ' (H)' and ' (BV)' at the end of several 
     pathway labels as they were not necessary in this subset of pathways.

Fig 1: Summary of findings & mechanisms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A) - Added a box of the same background colour to obscure 'Atopobium' and 
     added a text box containing 'Fannyhessea'- change requested by reviewer 1
